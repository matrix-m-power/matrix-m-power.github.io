# M-POWER Resource Page

The project aims to explore available AI tools and resources to meet the needs of stakeholders (Cross-section of AI and HealthCare) within the [AIM-AHEAD Coordinating Center (ACC)](https://www.aim-ahead.net/). It focuses on promoting innovation and collaboration among AIM-AHEAD members through open-source AI/ML toolkits. Additionally, the project seeks to nurture a community of researchers by providing support and training on M-POWER open-source tools, addressing unmet needs, and facilitating workforce development.

## Types of Medical DataSet
- **EEG (Electroencephalogram) Dataset**:EEG datasets consist of recordings of electrical activity along the scalp, typically collected via electrodes, to measure brain activity. These datasets are used in various applications such as diagnosing epilepsy, sleep disorders, and cognitive neuroscience research.
- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Dataset**:MRI datasets contain images generated using magnetic fields and radio waves to visualize internal structures of the body, including the brain, muscles, and organs. These datasets are vital for diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as tumors, strokes, and neurological disorders.
- **ECG (Electrocardiogram) Dataset**:ECG datasets capture the electrical activity of the heart through electrodes placed on the skin. They provide valuable information about heart rate, rhythm, and abnormalities, aiding in the diagnosis of cardiac conditions like arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.
- **EMG (Electromyogram) Dataset**: EMG datasets record the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, usually detected through surface or needle electrodes. These datasets are used to evaluate muscle function, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, and monitor conditions such as muscular dystrophy and nerve damage.
- **CT (Computed Tomography) Dataset**: CT datasets consist of cross-sectional images generated by combining multiple X-ray images taken from different angles. These datasets are instrumental in diagnosing conditions such as bone fractures, tumors, and internal bleeding, providing detailed views of the body's structures.
- **X-ray Dataset**: X-ray datasets comprise images produced by passing X-rays through the body to capture images of bones and soft tissues. Widely used for diagnosing fractures, pneumonia, and other medical conditions, X-ray datasets play a crucial role in medical imaging and diagnosis.
- **fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Dataset**:fMRI datasets measure brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow associated with neural activity. These datasets are used to study brain function, cognition, and neurological disorders, providing insights into areas of the brain involved in specific tasks or behaviors.
- 	**Genomic Dataset**: Genomic datasets contain information about an organism's complete set of DNA, including genes, genetic variations, and regulatory elements. These datasets are used in genomic research to study genetic diseases, population genetics, and personalized medicine.
- **Proteomic Dataset**: Proteomic datasets consist of information about the structure, function, and interactions of proteins within cells or organisms. These datasets are valuable for understanding cellular processes, identifying biomarkers for diseases, and developing targeted therapies.
- **Blood Pressure Dataset**: Blood pressure datasets contain measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, often collected over time. These datasets are essential for monitoring hypertension, assessing cardiovascular risk, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions such as medication and lifestyle changes.
- **Spirometry Dataset**: Spirometry datasets include measurements of lung function parameters, such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). These datasets are used to diagnose and monitor respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis.
